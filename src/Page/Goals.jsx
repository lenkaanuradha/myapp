            I bring a strong blend of technical expertise, problem-solving
            skills, and a passion for continuous learning to the table. My
            proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms, backed by solving
            400+ problems on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks,
            showcases my ability to tackle complex problems efficiently. As a
            full-stack web developer, I possess hands-on experience with modern
            technologies, including React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and
            Socket.io, enabling me to build scalable and dynamic applications.
            Moreover, my academic foundation in Computer Science equips me with
            a solid understanding of core concepts like OOP, DBMS, and Operating
            Systems. I also excel at adapting to new challenges, whether it's
            mastering advanced frameworks, optimizing solutions, or contributing
            effectively to team-based projects. My dedication, combined with a
            growth-oriented mindset, ensures that I consistently deliver value
            to every opportunity I take on.
